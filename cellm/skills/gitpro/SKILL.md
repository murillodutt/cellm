# gitpro — Universal Git Workflow

`gitpro` is the plugin-ready replacement for repository-specific git wrappers. It is universal by default, capability-driven, and safe in autonomous sessions.

## Intent

- Standardize semantic commits across projects.
- Push safely to the current branch (never hardcoded branch targets).
- Run sync workflows with optional version/changelog integration.
- Keep silent mode safe by aborting on dangerous states.

## Modes

| Arg | Action |
|---|---|
| `(none)` | Show concise status: working tree, branch, ahead/behind, pending commits |
| `commit` | Infer semantic message, stage, commit, run optional checks if available |
| `push` | Push current branch safely (with upstream setup when missing) |
| `sync` | Ordered pipeline: check -> optional bump -> commit -> push |
| `bump [version]` | Prefer `cellm:bump` delegation; fallback to project scripts if available |
| `check` | Dry-run capability and version/changelog sync checks |

## Delegated Mode (for orchestrators)

`gitpro` supports non-interactive delegated execution when called by a higher-level
orchestrator (example: `sk-git`).

Flags:
- `--delegated`: enable delegated contract
- `--op <mode>`: explicit operation (`commit|push|sync|bump|check|status`)

Delegated contract:
- skip Navigation Gate menus (M1/M2/M3)
- behave as `silent-safe` with fail-closed safety
- disable optional integrations unless explicitly requested by caller
- never ask confirmation prompts
- precedence rule: when `--delegated` is active, delegated contract overrides generic `--silent` defaults
- deterministic-safe: never widen scope from requested `--op`

## Navigation Gate (M1/M2/M3) — Execute-style

For state-changing flows (`commit`, `push`, `sync`, `bump`), `gitpro` MUST run a 3-menu navigation gate via `AskUserQuestion` before mutating the repository, except in delegated mode.

- In interactive runs: M1, M2, M3 are mandatory.
- In `--silent`: menus are skipped and resolved to safe defaults (never unsafe defaults).
- In `--delegated`: menus are skipped unconditionally and execution uses delegated contract.

### Menu 1 — Operation (M1)

Select operation route:
- `status`
- `check`
- `commit`
- `push`
- `sync`
- `bump`
- `abort`

Rules:
- If user passed an explicit mode argument, preselect it as recommendation.
- User MAY override recommendation in interactive mode.
- If M1 answer is missing, execution MUST NOT proceed.

### Menu 2 — Autonomy Level (M2)

Choose execution posture:
- `assisted` — confirmations at key mutation points.
- `silent-safe` — no confirmations, safety checks still enforced.

Rules:
- In interactive runs, M2 is mandatory.
- In `--silent`, force `silent-safe`.
- If M2 answer is missing in interactive mode, execution MUST NOT proceed.

### Menu 3 — Integration Policy (M3, multi-choice)

Choose optional integrations:
- `bump-if-needed`
- `changelog-if-available`
- `md-lint-if-md-changed`
- `skip-optional-integrations`

Rules:
- M3 is mandatory in interactive runs for state-changing flows.
- If `skip-optional-integrations` is selected, it overrides other optional choices.
- In `--silent`, default to: `bump-if-needed` + `md-lint-if-md-changed`, and `changelog-if-available` only when capability exists and no failure risk is introduced.
- In `--delegated`, default to `skip-optional-integrations` unless caller explicitly requests otherwise.

## --silent Contract

Silent mode skips confirmations, not safeguards.

- Sensitive files detected -> **ABORT**
- `identifier_guard` fails on staged JS/TS additions -> **ABORT**
- Remote ahead / non-fast-forward risk -> **ABORT**
- Pre-commit/lint failures not auto-fixable -> **ABORT**
- No changes in commit/sync -> report and exit

## Capability Detection (mandatory before action)

Detect capabilities in this order:

0. `skills/gitpro/scripts/identifier-guard.sh` exists and is executable (identifier fail-closed gate).
1. `cellm:bump` skill available for delegated version orchestration.
2. Bundled fallback script exists: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gitpro/scripts/gitpro-version-sync.sh`.
3. `scripts/sync-version.sh` exists (project-local fallback).
4. `package.json` scripts include changelog or release hooks.
5. Markdown lint scripts exist (`lint:md`, `lint:md:fix`).

If capability is missing, continue with degraded but explicit path. Never fail silently.

## Workflow Contract

### S0 — Preflight

1. Confirm inside git repository (`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`).
2. Capture current branch (`git branch --show-current`).
3. Capture ahead/behind state against upstream when configured.

Failure: not a git repo -> stop with actionable error.

### S1 — Navigation Gate (state-changing modes)

1. If NOT delegated: render M1/M2/M3 via `AskUserQuestion` (interactive mode only).
2. If delegated: resolve operation from `--op` (or explicit mode arg), set autonomy to `silent-safe`, and set integration policy to `skip-optional-integrations` unless caller explicitly overrides.
3. Persist resolved navigation decisions in run notes/output summary.

Hard rule:
- State-changing execution MUST NOT proceed without resolved M1/M2/M3 unless `--delegated` is active with explicit operation.
- In delegated mode, execution MUST NOT branch into additional operations not requested by `--op`.

### S2 — Check (mode `check` and as sync pre-step)

1. Run `scripts/sync-version.sh --check-only` when available.
   - Priority: bundled `gitpro-version-sync.sh --check-only --project-root <repo>`; if unavailable, project-local `scripts/sync-version.sh --check-only`.
2. Report version/changelog capability matrix.
3. Report staged/unstaged/untracked summary.

### S3 — Commit

1. Collect change signals (`git status --porcelain`, `git diff --name-only`, `git diff --cached --name-only`).
2. Run `identifier_guard` on staged additions before any commit:
   - command: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gitpro/scripts/identifier-guard.sh --project-root <repo> --mode <resolved-mode>`
   - mode policy:
     - `delegated` or `silent-safe`: hard fail, no override
     - `assisted`: exactly one explicit user confirmation may authorize re-run with `--allow-risk-override`
   - if guard fails and no explicit assisted override is approved: **ABORT**
3. Block sensitive files before staging (see list below).
4. Infer `type(scope): description` from changed paths and diff signals.
5. In `assisted`, confirm message; in `silent-safe`, apply safe default.
6. Stage and commit.
7. If staged `.md` files changed and `md-lint-if-md-changed` policy is active, run lint when capability exists.

Hard rules:
- Never amend unless explicitly requested.
- Never bypass hooks with `--no-verify`.
- Never commit with empty message or placeholder message.
- In delegated and silent-safe, never bypass `identifier_guard`.

### S4 — Bump

1. If `cellm:bump` is available, delegate first.
2. Else if bundled `gitpro-version-sync.sh` is available, execute it with `--project-root <repo>`.
3. Else if project-local `scripts/sync-version.sh` exists, execute script path.
4. Else return capability-not-available with recommendation, do not fabricate bump flow.

Hard rule:
- Partial bump result -> do not auto-commit bump outputs.

### S5 — Push

1. Resolve branch target from current branch.
2. If upstream missing, set with `git push -u origin <branch>`.
3. If upstream exists, `git push`.

Hard rules:
- Never push with force.
- If remote ahead, abort (silent) or ask for explicit decision (interactive).
- Never auto-pull/rebase in silent mode.

### S6 — Sync

Execute in order:
1. S2 check
2. Optional S4 bump (only when needed, supported, and policy-enabled)
3. S3 commit (if changes exist)
4. S5 push

## Sensitive Files (block before staging)

```
.env
.env.*
*.pem
*.key
*.p12
id_rsa
credentials.json
secrets.yaml
*.secret
config/secrets/*
```

Interactive: ask before excluding or aborting.
Silent: abort.

## Commit Message Format

```

```

## NEVER

- render M1/M2/M3 as plain text menu without `AskUserQuestion` in interactive runs
- proceed with state-changing execution when M1/M2/M3 are unresolved
- ask M1/M2/M3 in delegated mode (`--delegated`) — delegated calls are non-interactive by contract
- run delegated mode without explicit operation (`--op` or explicit mode arg)
- expand delegated `--op commit` into implicit bump/changelog/push without explicit caller request
- bypass `identifier_guard` in delegated or silent-safe mode
- `git push --force`
- `git reset --hard`
- `git commit --no-verify`
- `git commit --amend` (unless explicitly requested)
- `git rebase` without explicit user authorization
- silent auto-pull or silent auto-rebase
- auto-committing sensitive files
