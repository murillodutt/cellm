## The Problem

When you use Claude Code to develop software, it needs to understand your project's context: technologies, patterns, conventions, and common pitfalls. The problem? **Every new conversation starts from zero**. You end up:

- Repeating the same instructions
- Correcting the same mistakes
- Wasting time and money on tokens
- Fighting inconsistent code quality

---

## The Solution

**CELLM** (Spec-Driven Development System for AI Agents) provides structured specifications that AI agents consume to understand how to work on a project. Instead of repeating instructions each session, you write specs once and the agent loads them automatically.

### How It Works

1. **Layered Knowledge**: Global rules + project-specific context
2. **Stack-Optimized**: Surgically designed for Nuxt 4 + Vue + TypeScript + Tailwind + Drizzle + Stripe
3. **Concrete Rules**: Not vague theories—battle-tested patterns validated in production
4. **Specialized Agents**: Architect, Implementer, Reviewer working in concert

---

## The Difference

CELLM isn't generic. It's **precision-engineered** for a specific stack, which means:

- [+] **85%+ reduction** in recurring errors
- [+] **Concrete patterns**, not vague guidelines
- [+] **Validated in production**, not theoretical
- [+] **Complete workflow**, from planning to verification

---

## The Workflow

```
Define → Specify → Break Down → Implement → Verify
   ↓         ↓          ↓           ↓          ↓
Architect  Architect  PM     Implementer  Reviewer
```

Each phase has a specialized agent that knows exactly what to do and how to do it.

---

## The Impact

CELLM transforms Claude Code from a **generic assistant** into a **senior developer** who:

- [+] Knows your project deeply
- [+] Never forgets the rules
- [+] Maintains consistent quality
- [+] Improves continuously over time
